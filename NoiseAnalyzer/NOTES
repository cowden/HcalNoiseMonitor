HCalNoiseMonitor
========================================

Quick Start
----------------------------------------
After setting up a CMSSW release, navigate to this directory
and source the setup script in the scripts directory.
$source scripts/setup.sh

Then make a list of runs to be analyzed and put them in a text file
one run per line.  Navigate to some separate working area and create
the following directories:
+ data
+ logs
+ scripts

Generate configuration scripts and submit jobs to the batch system:
parallelizeJobs.sh runs.txt

Once the jobs have completed, combine output files.
for run in `cat runs.txt`; do hadd data/Hcal_noise_${run}.root data/Hcal_noise_${run}_*.root; done

Now, calculate noise rates:
for run in `cat runs.txt`; do rateCalc -r $run -s 1 data/Hcal_noise_${run}.root > rateLog_${run}.txt; done

The noise points can finally be added to the accumulated plots by running
the addTo* scripts found in the analysis directory.
for run in `cat runs.txt`; do addToHPDIonFeedback.sh $run rateLog_${run}.txt Run2HPDIonFeedback.gnu; addToHPDDischage.sh $run rateLog_${run}.txt run2HPDDischarge.gnu; addToRBX.sh $run rateLog_${run}.txt Run2RBXNoise.gnu; done



Directories
-----------------------------------------
+ analysis
Source code and scripts for the post processing analysis.
The scripts which accumulate noise rates for plotting are 
kept in this directory.

+ bin
When the source code is compiled from the anlaysis directory,
the executables are placed here.

+ scripts
The scripts used to setup configuration files in the analysis
are kept here.

+ python
This directory is kept empty in the repository.  During the setup
of the analysis, input file lists are kept in this directory.

+ interface
Header files for the EDAnalyzer are stored in this directory.

+ src
The EDAnalyzer source code for the main analysis is kept in this directory.
